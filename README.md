A Java client for the Zendesk API

## About The Project

`z4j` is a Java 17+ client for the Zendesk API, built with [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/). It is designed to be [Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation), resulting in quick performance and a low memory footprint.

## Getting Started

[Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md#set-up-your-machine).


## Key Advantages

`z4j` offers distinct advantages for building robust, high-performance applications:

*   **Performance and Efficiency:** Because `z4j` uses micronaut\'s AOT compilation, applications using z4j benefit from:
    *   **Faster Startup:** Quick Start time, a major advantage for microservices and serverless functions.
    *   **Lower Memory Footprint:** AOT-compiled applications use significantly less memory, reducing cloud hosting costs and allowing for more efficient resource utilization.
