        <p><strong>Note</strong>: Tags can&#39;t be re-used across custom ticket fields. For example, if you configure a tag for
            a checkbox field, you can&#39;t use that tag value for a dropdown (tagger) field option. The use of tags isn&#39;t
            validated and can prevent editing in the future.</p>
