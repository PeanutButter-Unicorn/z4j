      description: |-
        Returns an approximate count of tickets in the account. If the count exceeds 100,000, it is updated every 24 hours.

        `ccd` lists tickets that the specified user is cc'd on.

        The `count[refreshed_at]` property is a timestamp that indicates when the count was last updated.

        **Note**: When the count exceeds 100,000, `count[refreshed_at]` may occasionally be null.
        This indicates that the count is being updated in the background, and `count[value]` is limited to 100,000 until the update is complete.
